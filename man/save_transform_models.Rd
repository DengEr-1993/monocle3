\usage{
save_transform_models(cds, directory_path, comment = "", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{A cell_data_set with existing models.}

\item{directory_path}{A string giving the name of the directory
in which to write the model files.}

\item{comment}{A string with optional notes that is saved with
the objects.}

\item{verbose}{A boolean determining whether to print information
about the saved files.}
}
\value{
None.
}
\description{
Save the transform models to the specified directory
by writing the R objects to RDS files and
the Annoy nearest neighbor indexes to individual index files.
save_transform_models saves transform models made by running
the preprocess_cds, align_cds, and reduce_dimension functions
on an initial cell_data_set. Subsequent cell_data_sets are
transformed into the reduced dimension space of the initial
cds by loading the new data into a new cds, loading the
initial data set transform models into the new cds using
the load_transform_models function, and applying those transform models
to the new data set using the preprocess_transform,
align_transform, and reduce_dimension_transform functions.
In this case, do not run the preprocess_cds, align_cds, or
reduce_dimension functions on the new cds. Additionally,
save_transform_models saves Annoy nearest neighbor indexes
when the preprocess_cds, align_cds, and reduce_dimension
functions are run with the build_nn_index=TRUE parameter. These
indexes are used to find matches between cells in the new
processed cds and the initial cds using the xxx functions.
save_transform_models scans the initial cell_data_set for
models and Annoy nearest neighbor indexes and saves those
that it finds. It does not save transform models
and indexes that were not made using preprocess_cds,
align_cds, and reduce_dimension.
